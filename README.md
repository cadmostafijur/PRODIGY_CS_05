Network Packet Analyzer\n
This script listens for packets on the network and analyzes them. It prints out the source and destination IP addresses, as well as the source and destination TCP ports if the packet is a TCP packet. Additionally, it prints out the data payload if present.\n
You need to install Scapy to run this code. You can install it via pip:\n
Install: pip install scapy\n
Remember to run this script with appropriate permissions as it requires low-level network access, which might need elevated privileges.\n
This is a simple example, and you can extend it to include more detailed analysis based on your specific requirements. Additionally, you can filter packets based on various criteria or even manipulate packets before sending them out. Scapy provides a wide range of functionalities for network packet manipulation and analysis.
